<h1> F1 Pit Stop Strategist </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>

The F1 Pit Stop Strategist is a tool that helps Formula 1 teams optimize their pit stop strategies for any given race track and car setup. It takes into account various factors such as track conditions, car performance, and weather to provide the most effective pit stop strategy.

<h2> Features </h2>
- Supports any race track with customizable parameters like length, number of laps, and average speed
- Allows adjusting car performance parameters like downforce, tire wear, and fuel consumption
- Considers weather conditions like temperature and rain to predict tire degradation
- Calculates optimal pit stop timing and tire/fuel strategy
- Provides detailed analysis of the calculated strategy
 -Utilizes the termcolor library for colorized terminal output

<h2> Usage </h2>
To use the F1 Pit Stop Strategist, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary files, including main.cpp, TrackDetails.txt, CarDetails.txt, and termcolor.hpp.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler, such as g++ or clang.
3. Run the executable and follow the on-screen prompts to input the track and car details.
4. The program will then analyze the data and provide the optimal pit stop strategy for the given scenario.

<h2> Credits </h2>
The F1 Pit Stop Strategist utilizes the termcolor library, a header-only C++ library for printing colored messages to the terminal. Developed by Ihor Kalnytskyi, termcolor is licensed under the BSD license.
